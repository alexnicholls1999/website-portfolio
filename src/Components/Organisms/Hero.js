                        <h3>I am a UX Designer.</h3>
                        <p>I am currently an under-graduate student at Southampton Solent University studying for a BSc (Hons) in Web Design and Development and have just successfully completed year 2. Southampton Solent encourages students to seek industry placements and I am looking for an opportunity to consolidate my knowledge and skills and gain work experience in the Ô¨Åeld. My intention is to graduate with both academic and practical skills but also a greater understanding of the industry. I have developed a range of skills within front end development including Sketch, InVision and Hype. I see my future in the design industry and aspire to be a UX/UI designer, however, I am also a competent programmer who is keen to develop my programming skills.</p>
